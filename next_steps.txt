Great! I've explored the codebase. Here are my thoughts:

  My Assessment of coder-cc

  What it is: This is a clever local implementation of Claude Code that uses Ollama instead of
  Anthropic's API. It's essentially bringing AI coding assistance to your local machine with
  complete privacy and no API costs.

  Strengths:
  - Clean architecture (~671 lines of well-organized JavaScript)
  - Solid tool coverage (9 tools implemented including Bash, Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, etc.)
  - Good documentation (multiple guides and references)
  - Practical design (streaming support, session management, config system)
  - Zero dependencies for core functionality (just glob and yaml)

  Gaps I noticed:
  - No tests at all (the README even lists "Add tests" as a TODO)
  - Missing some advanced tools (NotebookEdit, Agent, Task orchestration)
  - No MCP (Model Context Protocol) support yet
  - Error handling could be more robust

  How to Start Testing

  Let me create a testing plan:

‚óè My Testing Recommendations

  1. Testing Framework Choice
  I'd recommend Vitest because:
  - Native ESM support (the project uses ES modules)
  - Fast and modern
  - Jest-compatible API
  - Great for Node.js projects

  2. Testing Strategy (in priority order):

  Phase 1: Unit Tests for Tools (easiest to start)
  - Test each tool in src/tools/ individually
  - Mock filesystem operations
  - Test edge cases (invalid inputs, missing files, etc.)
  - Example: Test glob.js pattern matching, edit.js text replacement

  Phase 2: Integration Tests for Ollama Client
  - Mock HTTP responses from Ollama API
  - Test streaming responses
  - Test error handling (connection failures, invalid models)

  Phase 3: SDK Integration Tests
  - Test the conversation loop
  - Test tool invocation and response handling
  - Test session management

  Phase 4: End-to-End Tests
  - Test actual CLI interactions
  - May need Ollama running or mocked

  Would you like me to:
  1. Set up the testing framework (install Vitest, create config)
  2. Write example tests for a few tools to get you started
  3. Create a full testing infrastructure with CI/CD setup

  What would be most helpful?
