Coder-CC Testing Summary

  Project Overview

  coder-cc is a local implementation of Claude Code that runs entirely offline using Ollama
  instead of Anthropic's API. It provides AI-powered coding assistance with tool execution
  capabilities (file operations, bash commands, web search, etc.) using local LLM models.

  Repository Location: C:\agents\coder-cc
  Target Environment: Air-gapped Ubuntu machine
  Testing Environment: Windows 11 (win32)

  What We Accomplished

  1. Initial Setup & Configuration ‚úÖ

  Actions Taken:
  - Installed dependencies (npm install - 42 packages)
  - Verified Ollama installation (v0.12.6)
  - Identified available model: qwen3:32b (20GB)
  - Changed default model from mistral:latest to qwen3:32b in src/config.js:77

  Files Modified:
  - src/config.js - Updated default model

  2. Fixed Critical Bugs üêõ

  Bug #1: Thinking Token Spam

  Problem: qwen3:32b's "thinking" feature was streaming individual tokens, flooding console output
   with hundreds of lines like:
  [THINKING]  application
  [THINKING]  executable
  [THINKING]  accordingly

  Solution: Modified src/ollama-client.js:216-224 to completely suppress thinking tokens during
  streaming.

  Files Modified:
  - src/ollama-client.js - Added thinking token filter

  Bug #2: No Platform Detection

  Problem: Model was using Unix commands (mkdir -p, rm -f) on Windows, causing all file operations
   to fail silently.

  Solution:
  - Created comprehensive platform detection system in src/cli.js
  - Added getPlatformInfo() function that detects Windows/macOS/Linux
  - Added buildSystemPrompt() that injects platform-specific guidance
  - System prompt now includes:
    - OS name and platform code
    - Shell type (PowerShell/CMD vs bash)
    - Path separator (\ vs /)
    - Platform-specific command examples
    - Working directory
    - Clear instructions to use Write tool for file creation

  Files Modified:
  - src/cli.js - Added platform detection (lines 13-85)
  - src/cli.js - Added platform display at startup (lines 106-109)

  Bug #3: Debug Logging Configuration

  Problem: Debug flags only configurable via environment variables, difficult to manage across
  multiple projects.

  Solution:
  - Added debugTools config option to src/config.js
  - Wired debug flag through SDK to OllamaClient
  - Made debug logging controlled by config file instead of env vars

  Files Modified:
  - src/config.js - Added debugTools config option (line 91)
  - src/sdk.mjs - Pass debugTools to OllamaClient (line 35)
  - src/ollama-client.js - Store and use debugTools flag (lines 11, 218)

  Testing Results

  Test Case: Create CLI Todo Application

  Prompt:
  "Create a simple CLI todo application in the test-cc directory. It should support add, list,
  complete, and delete commands. Store todos in a JSON file. all in this agents\test-cc\ path
  please"

  Result: ‚úÖ SUCCESS (with minor issues)

  What Worked:
  1. ‚úÖ Tool calling executed properly (Glob, Bash, Write tools all invoked)
  2. ‚úÖ Model recognized Windows platform
  3. ‚úÖ Generated PowerShell code (not bash!)
  4. ‚úÖ Created fully functional todo app with:
    - All 4 commands (add, list, complete, delete)
    - JSON persistence
    - Error handling
    - Proper PowerShell syntax (ConvertTo-Json, PSCustomObject, Join-Path)
  5. ‚úÖ No thinking spam in output
  6. ‚úÖ Clean, well-structured code (99 lines)

  Issues Found:
  1. ‚ö†Ô∏è Path ambiguity: Created C:\agents\coder-cc\agents\test-cc\ instead of C:\agents\test-cc\
    - Interpreted relative path from working directory
    - Need to emphasize absolute paths in prompts
  2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor code bug: PowerShell array append issue (line 22 of generated code)
    - Expected with local models
    - Easily fixable
  3. ‚ö†Ô∏è No tool output visibility: CLI doesn't show tool execution results to user
    - User can't see what Write/Bash/Glob returned
    - Makes debugging difficult

  Generated File:
  - C:\agents\coder-cc\agents\test-cc\todo.ps1 (99 lines, functional PowerShell script)

  Moving to Ubuntu: Next Steps

  1. Transfer Files

  Copy the entire coder-cc directory with your modifications:
  # On Ubuntu
  scp -r user@windows-machine:/mnt/c/agents/coder-cc ~/coder-cc

  Or use git to track your changes and clone on Ubuntu.

  2. Ubuntu Setup

  cd ~/coder-cc

  # Install Node.js 18+ if not present
  node --version  # Check version

  # Install dependencies
  npm install

  # Install Ollama (if not already installed)
  curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

  # Start Ollama
  ollama serve &

  # Pull a model
  ollama pull qwen3:32b
  # OR try other tool-compatible models:
  # ollama pull llama3.1:8b
  # ollama pull mistral
  # ollama pull command-r:35b

  3. Verify Platform Detection

  npm start
  # Should show:
  # Platform: Linux (linux)
  # Shell: bash

  4. Test Basic Functionality

  npm start
  # Ask: "Create a simple hello.py file that prints 'Hello from Ubuntu'"
  # Should use Write tool and create the file

  5. Known Differences: Windows vs Ubuntu

  | Aspect         | Windows            | Ubuntu        |
  |----------------|--------------------|---------------|
  | Platform code  | win32              | linux         |
  | Shell          | PowerShell/CMD     | bash          |
  | Path separator | \                  | /             |
  | Bash commands  | Limited/WSL        | Native        |
  | File paths     | C:\path\to\file    | /path/to/file |
  | Tool execution | May use PowerShell | Direct bash   |

  The system prompt will automatically adapt to Linux when you run it on Ubuntu.

  6. Air-Gapped Deployment Considerations

  For the final air-gapped Ubuntu machine:

  Required Files:
  - coder-cc/ directory (entire project)
  - Ollama binary + model files (download separately):
    - Ollama: ~/.ollama/
    - Models: ~/.ollama/models/
  - Node.js runtime (if not pre-installed)

  Pre-download on connected machine:
  # Pull models before going air-gapped
  ollama pull qwen3:32b
  ollama pull llama3.1:8b  # backup option

  # Copy Ollama installation
  cp -r ~/.ollama ~/ollama-backup

  # On air-gapped machine, restore:
  cp -r ~/ollama-backup ~/.ollama

  Test air-gapped mode:
  # Disconnect network
  sudo ip link set <interface> down

  # Verify Ollama works offline
  ollama list
  ollama run qwen3:32b "Hello"

  # Test coder-cc
  npm start

  Recommendations for Ubuntu Testing

  High Priority Tests

  1. ‚úÖ File operations - Create, read, edit, delete files
  2. ‚úÖ Multi-file projects - Generate projects with multiple files
  3. ‚úÖ Bash commands - Native Linux command execution
  4. ‚úÖ Path handling - Absolute vs relative paths on Linux
  5. ‚úÖ Edit tool - Test file modification capabilities

  Medium Priority Tests

  1. üìã TodoWrite tool - Task tracking functionality
  2. üîç Glob/Grep tools - Search across large codebases
  3. üåê WebFetch - If needed (may not work air-gapped)
  4. üìì NotebookEdit - If using Jupyter notebooks
  5. üîÑ Session resumption - Load previous sessions

  Future Enhancements

  1. Better tool result display - Show what tools actually did
  2. Improved error messages - More helpful debugging info
  3. Path normalization - Handle relative/absolute paths better
  4. Alternative models - Test llama3.1, mistral, command-r
  5. Custom system prompts - Project-specific instructions
  6. MCP server support - If needed for your use case

  Conclusion

  Coder-CC Status: ‚úÖ Functional and Ready for Ubuntu Testing

  We successfully:
  - ‚úÖ Got coder-cc running on Windows with qwen3:32b
  - ‚úÖ Fixed critical bugs (thinking spam, platform detection)
  - ‚úÖ Verified tool calling works correctly
  - ‚úÖ Generated functional, platform-appropriate code
  - ‚úÖ Identified and documented known issues

  Next Milestone: Test on Ubuntu with native bash environment, then deploy to air-gapped machine.

  Key Takeaway: The core implementation is solid. The main improvements needed are UX enhancements
   (tool output visibility) and prompt refinements. The architecture supports cross-platform
  operation well.
